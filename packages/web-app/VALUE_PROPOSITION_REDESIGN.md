# Value Proposition Redesign: From Due Diligence to Custom Knowledge Graph Platform

## Current Problem
The landing page frames Bio KGnome primarily as a "due diligence tool" which:
- Minimizes the platform's capabilities
- Doesn't emphasize the custom knowledge graph
- Doesn't highlight AI-enabled research capabilities
- Makes it sound like a service, not a platform

## Target Positioning (Similar to Causaly.com)
Causaly positions itself as:
- **"AI-powered research platform"** for biomedical research
- **"Knowledge graph"** that connects biomedical evidence
- **"Answer complex research questions"** in seconds
- **"Evidence-based insights"** from millions of publications
- Focus on **research capabilities**, not just one use case

## Proposed New Value Proposition

### Core Positioning
**"Your Custom Biomedical Knowledge Graph. AI-Enabled Research That Answers Highly Specific Questions in Seconds."**

### Key Messaging Shifts

#### 1. Hero Section
**Current:**
- "Due Diligence Taking 2-3 Months? You're Missing Critical Risks."
- Focuses on one use case (due diligence)

**Proposed:**
- "Ask Highly Specific Biomedical Questions. Get Evidence-Backed Answers in Seconds."
- "Your Custom Knowledge Graph Powered by 127+ Biomedical APIs"
- Emphasizes the platform's research capabilities

#### 2. Value Proposition Hierarchy

**Primary Value:**
- Custom knowledge graph (not just a tool)
- AI-enabled research (not just due diligence)
- Highly specific questions (not just standard reports)
- 127+ API integration (unique capability)

**Secondary Value (Use Cases):**
- Due diligence (one of many use cases)
- Target discovery
- Competitive intelligence
- Mechanism validation
- White space identification

#### 3. Messaging Framework

**Headline Options:**
1. "Your Custom Biomedical Knowledge Graph. AI-Enabled Research That Answers Highly Specific Questions."
2. "Ask Any Biomedical Question. Get Evidence-Backed Answers from 127+ APIs in Seconds."
3. "The Research Platform That Connects 127+ Biomedical Databases. Custom to Your Questions."

**Subheadline:**
- "Bio KGnome builds a custom knowledge graph from 127+ biomedical APIs. Ask highly specific questions—from target validation to competitive intelligence—and get traceable, evidence-backed answers in seconds."

**Key Differentiators:**
1. **Custom Knowledge Graph** - Built specifically for your research questions
2. **127+ API Integration** - Simultaneous queries across major biomedical databases
3. **AI-Enabled Research** - Multi-hop reasoning finds connections humans miss
4. **Highly Specific Questions** - Not just standard reports, but custom research
5. **Evidence-Backed** - Every answer cites exact sources (DrugBank, ClinicalTrials.gov, PubMed, etc.)

## Proposed Copy Changes

### Hero Section
```
Headline: "Your Custom Biomedical Knowledge Graph"
Subheadline: "AI-Enabled Research That Answers Highly Specific Questions in Seconds"

Body: "Bio KGnome builds a custom knowledge graph from 127+ biomedical APIs. 
Ask highly specific questions—from target validation to competitive intelligence—
and get traceable, evidence-backed answers in seconds."

Value Props:
- Custom Knowledge Graph (not one-size-fits-all)
- 127+ API Integration (simultaneous queries)
- AI-Enabled Research (multi-hop reasoning)
- Evidence-Backed (every answer cites sources)
```

### Problem/Solution Section
**Current:** "Biotech Companies Drown in Data. They Starve for Synthesis."

**Proposed:** 
"Every critical research question requires connecting data across 127+ biomedical databases. 
Traditional methods take weeks. Bio KGnome builds your custom knowledge graph and answers 
highly specific questions in seconds."

### Use Cases Section (Not Primary Focus)
Instead of leading with "For VCs" or "For Biotechs", lead with research capabilities:

**Primary:**
- Custom Knowledge Graph Platform
- AI-Enabled Research
- Highly Specific Question Answering

**Use Cases (Secondary):**
- Due Diligence (VCs)
- Target Discovery (Biotechs)
- Competitive Intelligence (Pharma)
- Mechanism Validation (CROs)

## Comparison: Current vs. Proposed

### Current Positioning
- **Primary:** Due diligence tool
- **Secondary:** Knowledge graph platform
- **Messaging:** "Complete DD in 2-5 days"
- **Focus:** One use case (due diligence)

### Proposed Positioning
- **Primary:** Custom knowledge graph & AI-enabled research platform
- **Secondary:** Multiple use cases (due diligence is one)
- **Messaging:** "Ask highly specific questions, get evidence-backed answers"
- **Focus:** Research capabilities and platform power

## Causaly-Inspired Messaging

### Causaly's Approach:
- "AI-powered research platform"
- "Answer complex research questions"
- "Evidence-based insights"
- "Millions of publications"

### Bio KGnome's Equivalent:
- "Custom knowledge graph platform"
- "Answer highly specific biomedical questions"
- "Evidence-backed answers from 127+ APIs"
- "127+ biomedical databases"

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Hero Section
1. Change headline to emphasize knowledge graph
2. Add "AI-Enabled Research" messaging
3. Emphasize "highly specific questions"
4. Move due diligence to use cases section

### Phase 2: Value Props
1. Lead with "Custom Knowledge Graph"
2. Emphasize "127+ API Integration"
3. Highlight "AI-Enabled Research"
4. Show "Evidence-Backed" as differentiator

### Phase 3: Use Cases
1. Reframe as "Research Capabilities"
2. Show multiple use cases equally
3. Due diligence becomes one of many
4. Emphasize customizability

## Key Messaging Pillars

1. **Custom Knowledge Graph** - Built for your specific research questions
2. **127+ API Integration** - Simultaneous queries across major databases
3. **AI-Enabled Research** - Multi-hop reasoning finds hidden connections
4. **Highly Specific Questions** - Not just standard reports
5. **Evidence-Backed** - Every answer cites exact sources
6. **Traceable** - Every path is verifiable
7. **IIT-Developed** - Institutional credibility

## Competitive Differentiation

**vs. Causaly:**
- Custom knowledge graph (not pre-built)
- 127+ API integration (broader coverage)
- Multi-hop reasoning (finds hidden connections)
- Use case flexibility (due diligence, target discovery, etc.)

**vs. Traditional Tools:**
- AI-enabled (not just search)
- Custom knowledge graph (not one-size-fits-all)
- 127+ APIs (not single database)
- Evidence-backed (not just results)
